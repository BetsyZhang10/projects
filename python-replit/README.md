# Info For Python Projects
To be updated...

Notes for myself: 
- add links to code in github
- add links to code in replit
- add link to replit project for main.py
- show how to run the code

**Most projects will be created either on [replit](replit.com) or Visual Studio Code. To play the games and run the code, you can download a zip file here on github. For all other purposes, please read LICENSE on the home page of this repo. Thanks!**
